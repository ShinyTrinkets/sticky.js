My original inspiration: https://nedbatchelder.com/code/cog
> Cog transforms files in a very simple way: it finds chunks of Python code embedded in them, executes the Python code, and inserts its output back into the original file. The file can contain whatever text you like around the Python code. It will usually be source code.

Very similar:
https://github.com/mosjs/mos
> A pluggable module that injects content into your markdown files via hidden JavaScript snippets

Kind of similar:
https://github.com/albinotonnina/mmarkdown
